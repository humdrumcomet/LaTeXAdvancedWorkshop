Welcom to an introduction to some of (in my opinion) LaTeX's coolest abilities.

I have organized the files to all compile as standalones (the tikz images, the subfiles, and the
beamer presentation), but to all share the same preambles, glossary list, symbols list, acronyms, etc.

The reason for this is to virtually eliminate duplication anywhere, and make it that if anything 
is changed, that change propagates through all the various forms the document may take.

Its also setup to be nothing but relative paths, so that if you're synchronizing a folder across
multiple devices, this won't create an issue.
